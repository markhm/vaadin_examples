# Vaadin Examples

A repository with examples based on Vaadin Flow 14. 

Initial aim is to provide a good example of D3js integration with loading data from the Vaadin application.

- Vaadin 14 with Spring Boot
- Uses JAR-based packaging, so resources are in 'src/main/resources/META-INF/resources'
- Property file filtering, see 'src/main/resources/env/application.dev.properties', etc.

h4. To get started
- mvn package
- mvn jetty:run
